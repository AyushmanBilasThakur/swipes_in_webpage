# The swipe card

This is one of the supportive project for my post on how to get swipe gestures in a webpage. This post is available in [dev.to]() (will be updated as soon as the post goes live) and the site is on [Glitch]() (also will be updated later on hosting). Please use mobile devices for proper experience of the swipe gesture.

So, this post is all about how to detect a swipe in webpages and it also explains the touch related eventlisteners provided in out browsers.
